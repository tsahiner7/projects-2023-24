                        <h2>Fawcett Comics</h2>
                        <p>One of the most successful comic book publisher in the
                            1940's, Fawcett Publications began in 1919 with the
                            magazine, <cite>Captain Billy's Whiz Bang</cite>. Its
                            total circulation from all of its publications
                            eventually reached over 10 million issues a month.</p>
                        <p>Fawcett is best known for its popular superhero, Captain
                            Marvel, based on the adventures of radio reporter Billy
                            Batson who would turn into Captain Marvel upon uttering
                            the word <em>Shazam!</em>. Other successful characters
                            include Ibis the Invincible, Hopalong Cassidy, and
                            Mister Scarlet. Fawcett was also known for its series of
                            horror comics including <cite>Beware! Terror
                                Tales</cite>, <cite>Worlds of Fear</cite>, and
                            <cite>Strange Suspense Stories</cite>. The company
                            branched out into humor comic magazines with <cite>Otis

                            popular titles.</p>
                        <p>Facing declining sales, Fawcett Comics ceased publication
                            of its superhero titles in 1953. Several of its titles
                            were eventually sold to Charlton Comics.</p>
