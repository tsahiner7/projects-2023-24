                <li class="row">
                    <img src="images/sun.webp" class="img-fluid col-lg-5 me-4" alt="shining sun">
                    <p class="col-lg-6"><b>Light</b>: Most veggies, especially those that bear fruit (tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, and
                    peppers, for example) need sun, and a lot of it. Ideally, you want a site with at least 8 hours of
                    direct sun per day. In less light, you can still grow some edibles; mainly leafy crops and herbs.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="row">
                    <img src="images/soil.png" class="img-fluid col-lg-5 me-4" alt="growing seed in soil">
                    <p class="col-lg-6"><b>Soil</b>: Healthy, rich soil is the key to a successful and productive vegetable
                    garden, so don’t skip this step! A soil test will give you an idea of your existing soil fertility
                    and pH, and offer suggestions of what types of fertilizers or amendments will get your plot up to
                    par. In my own garden, I rely on homemade compost, organic well-composted animal manures, and
                    organic fertilizers like kelp meal and alfalfa meal.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="row">
                    <img src="images/sizes.webp" class="img-fluid col-lg-5 me-4" alt="sizes for gardening">
                    <p class="col-lg-6"><b>Size</b>: A vegetable garden can be low-maintenance, but it’s not no-maintenance. Therefore, do
                    yourself a favor and stick to a small plot for the first year or two. A 4 by 8 foot bed is ideal for
                    a starter veggie garden and will give you enough space to grow a handful of crops (see the next
                    point). If you wish to start even smaller, try planting container-friendly veggies and herbs in pots
                    or window-boxes on a sunny deck.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="row">
                    <img src="images/vegetablesPlant.jpeg" class="img-fluid col-lg-5 me-4" alt="harvested fresh vegetables">
                    <p class="col-lg-6"><b>Plants</b>: With your first veggie garden, it’s very tempting to want to grow everything! But,
                    for your own sake, I’d suggest you pick 4 to 5 types of vegetables and grow them well. Trying to
                    cram too much in a compact space is asking for trouble and you’ll end up with a smaller, not larger
                    harvest. However, you can boost yield by succession planting. When your initial crops have been
                    harvested, follow up with a second sowing. For example, follow spring lettuce with summer beans.
                    Succession planting allows you to stretch your harvest season for the longest possible time.</p>

                    <img src="images/good-bugs.jpeg" class="img-fluid col-lg-5 me-4" alt="beneficial bugs for soil and seeds">
                    <p class="col-lg-6"><b>Bugs</b>: Ok, this might be hard to believe, but most bugs are your friends! Yup, it’s true.
                    Think bees, butterflies, <a href="http://savvygardening.com/snapped-good-guy-flies/"
                        target="_blank">tachinid flies</a>, ladybugs and more! To attract these good guys to your garden
                    – and boost crop pollination – include clumps of insect-friendly plants like sweet alyssum, zinnias,
                    cosmos, and sunflowers between the veggies and herbs.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="row">
                    <img src="images/watering.jpeg" class="img-fluid col-lg-5 me-4" alt="watering plants">
                    <p class="col-lg-6"><b>Water, weed & feed</b>: This might seem to be one of the most obvious vegetable gardening tips,
                    but new veggie gardeners may not know when or how much to water. Newly seeded beds will need
                    frequent watering, but most established crops can get by on one to two inches of water per week. To
                    conserve water and reduce the need to irrigate, mulch your soil with several inches of straw or
                    shredded leaves.</p>
                    <p class="col mt-2"><b>Side benefit</b>: the mulch will also suppress weeds! As for feeding, quick growing
                    crops like radishes and lettuce won’t need supplemental fertilizers if grown in in fertile soil.
                    Long-term veggies like tomatoes, winter squash, and eggplants, however, will appreciate a boost
                    several times over the growing season. Give them an occasional dose of a water soluble organic
                    food to support growth and encourage the biggest harvest.</p>
